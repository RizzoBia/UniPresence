# ðŸŽ“ UniPresence

**UniPresence** is a multi-phase project designed to optimize attendance tracking at our university. Initially developed during an **IoT-focused module**, the system integrates **QR Code scanning** using an **ESP32-CAM** to simplify and automate presence registration.

## Phase 1: IoT Integration
The first phase emphasized:
- **IoT**
- **Networking**
- **Python-based algorithms**

This phase combined content from:
- Computer Networks
- IoT
- Algorithm & Programming
- Human-Computer Interface courses

## Phase 2: System Modeling and Development
In the second phase, the focus has shifted towards:
- **Business Intelligence**
- **Data Modeling**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Logic Programming**

This phase enhances the original IoT-based solution with:
- Robust data analysis
- Improved logic structures
- Comprehensive system modeling

Together, these improvements create a more efficient and scalable solution for attendance management.

With **UniPresence**, we aim to streamline the way attendance is tracked in educational institutions, making it more **accurate**, **automated**, and **scalable**.
